# ARMv8 Assembler, LED Control, and Cocktail Machine Project

## Overview
This project was developed as part of a group assignment, combining **low-level programming**, **hardware interfacing**, and **embedded systems**.  
It consists of three main parts:
1. **A C-based ARMv8 assembler** ‚Äì converts ARMv8 assembly instructions into machine code.
2. **An ARMv8 assembly LED control program** ‚Äì flashes an LED via Raspberry Pi GPIO pins.
3. **An extension project: Classy Unit Mixer** ‚Äì an automated cocktail mixing machine controlled by a Raspberry Pi.

## Features

### 1Ô∏èARMv8 Assembler
- **Two-pass architecture** for improved clarity and debugging.
- Uses **hashmap-based symbol table** for efficient label lookups.
- **Intermediate representation (IR)** design decouples parsing and assembling.
- Tokenization and parsing combined in `parseLine` for streamlined processing.
- Bitwise encoding of instructions inspired by the reverse of the emulator‚Äôs decoding process.
- **Testing & Debugging**:
  - Systematic test case isolation using gdb.
  - Binary search approach to pinpoint issues.
  - Clear, compartmentalized code for easier fixes.

---

### LED Control Program
- Fully parametric: arbitrary **pin selection** and **timing** via `.int` directives.
- Dynamic calculation of memory addresses and bitmasks for **GPFSEL**, **GPSET**, and **GPCLR** registers.
- Simple **on/off loop** with delay cycles.
- Supports both low (<32) and high (‚â•32) GPIO pins.

### Extension: Classy Unit Mixer üçπ
**An automatic cocktail mixing machine**:
- **Hardware**:
  - 5 peristaltic pumps wired in parallel, each controlled by a MOSFET.
  - CAD-designed wooden chassis, laser-cut and slotted together.
  - Flexible food-safe tubing with custom 3D-printed connectors.
  - Reliable 5A power supply after troubleshooting voltage/current issues.
- **Software**:
  - Built with **pigpio** library for GPIO control.
  - **Finite State Machine (FSM)** architecture for menu and dispensing logic.
  - Multithreaded dispensing for speed (parallel pump control).
  - Debounce logic for button inputs.
  - Configurable via `#define` macros for easy recipe changes.
  - Installed as a **systemd service** for auto-start and crash recovery.
- **Testing**:
  - Flow rate calibration for accurate pouring.
  - Breadboard prototyping with LEDs and buttons before final assembly.
